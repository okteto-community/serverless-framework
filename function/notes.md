# Hello Serverless Function

The Serverless Framework helps you develop and deploy AWS Lambda functions, along with the AWS infrastructure resources they require. Integrate it with Okteto to give your developers access to development environments that integrate serverless functions with other resources.

More information on how to use the serverless framework [is available here](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/intro).
